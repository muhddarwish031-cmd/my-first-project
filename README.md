## 💡 Design Process

I followed a structured design workflow to ensure the **VORTEX** app is both functional and visually appealing:

- **User Flow & Wireframing:** Mapped out the user journey from the Splash Screen and Login to the main Dashboard and User Profile.
- **Visual Design & Branding:** Applied a modern aesthetic using a purple-to-blue gradient theme to create a premium feel for interior design enthusiasts.
- **UI Components Creation:** Developed reusable components including input fields for authentication, a structured grid system for the Photo Stream, and a comprehensive Profile layout.
- **Interactive Prototyping:** Connected screens using Figma's prototyping tools to simulate real-world interactions, such as clicking a gallery item to view details.
- **UX Optimization:** Integrated an intuitive Bottom Navigation Bar (Home, Post, Profile) to ensure seamless transitions and a user-friendly experience.
